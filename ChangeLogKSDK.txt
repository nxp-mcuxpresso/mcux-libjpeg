@section LibJpeg LigJpeg for KSDK
Current version is LigJpeg 9b.

  - 9b_rev2
    - New Feature:
      - Integrate the hardware jpeg decoder. When the SoC has the jpeg decoder hardware IP, and the JPEG file format is supported by
        the hardware, the lib jpeg will use hardware to decode, otherwise use the old software way.

  - 9b_rev1
    - New Feature:
      - The configuration file libjpeg/inc/jmorecfg.h could include user defined header file to override pixel format configuration.

  - 9b_rev0
    - Initial version. Changes when integrate with SDK:
      - In libjpeg/inc/jinclude.h line 88-96, map JFREAD and JFWRITE to FATFS f_read and f_write
      - In libjpeg/inc/jmorecfg.h line 397-406, change RGB color offset.
      - In libjpeg/src/jerror.c line 79-81, don't call function exit.
